Some time ago I got a hold of a list of what kind of batteries different sensors use. I haven't tried all of these out, but thought I'd share anyway.

* CR2032 (Xiaomi temp, Xiaomi buttons (switches), Visonic door sensor)
* CR123A (Fibaro pir, Neo Coolcam pir)
* CR1632 (Xiaomi door sensor)
* CR2450 (Xiaomi motion)
* CR14250 (Neo Coolcam door sensor)
* ER14250 (Fibaro door sensor)
